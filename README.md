Modern software resembles the Egyptian pyramids. 
Millions of blocks somehow stand on top of each other without any structural integrity, but with the help of the hard labor of thousands of slaves.

The programmer decided to borrow 1000 rubles from a friend, but for an even account he took 1024.

Have a nice day! And it's not up for discussion 🙃
